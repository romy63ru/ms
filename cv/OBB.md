## About me

Im working like Platform architect in Oriflame Sowtware about 6 years. Full staff employee

Now work like part of integration team (backoffice), but most of time Im working alone. Standard project flow: dicsuss environments with customers (my customers other internal team leads/architects) - propose solution - implement prototype - run it - handover to dev/support team)

Also I participant like infrastucture Guild (propose/add some feature to boilerplate) - for example on current project I use ABP framework like pilot, and after complte project this framework will be included to own micrososervice boilerplate

For me is very comfortable use TDD methodology

Good solution alwais is compromise with agility, costs and quality. x

No problem for traveling 2 days per week  - beacuse train every 2 hours and spent 2,5 hours

### Most big fail

- [ ] Find and describe
about 4 years ago I started one of the internal projects and succumbed to the pressure of the customer although it was clear that the technologies were already obsolete at that time. Now the project is closed

## Questions:

 - I have very naive information about current project. Could you please explained about technologies and approach?
 - Do you use unit tests? TDD? What is your coverage (about) What you want? Do you have test team?
 - Agile, every day scrum meeting? How set, estimated and complete tasks?
 - Pipelines? Who response for delivery? 
 - Team structure?
 - Tools?
 - Do you have project roadmap? What in your Epics log?

### Technical 

 - Why rabbitMQ not Azure queue?
 - Why 3th party software for pipeline not Azure pipeline
 - Who response for technology decision? Name (maybe not now)

## Reasons


 - [ ] Why I find new opportunity
On own company we used millions of message for each user action
 
# Round II 

 - Daniella sow about not decision yet
 - Maybe need some more time for execution
